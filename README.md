# Belly_Button_Biodiveersity
To create a dashboard that will display data of bacteria species isolated from the belly-button of different subjects (individual) 

### Overview of the Belly-Button Biodiversity Challenge

The purpose of this work / challenge is to create a dashboard display data of bacteria species isolated from the belly-button of different subjects (individual). These bacteria species are believed to have the capability to synthesize proteins that can be used for beef production. This work also invoved;

  1. Creating a horizontal bar chart
  2. Creating a bubble chart
  3. Creating a gauge chart
  3. Displaying these charts with its dynamic data in a customized dashboard that is mobile responsive, with a nice image and background

To generate these analysis, I utilized the following resources;

  - Data Source: samples.json file which contain relevant data of subjects used for the challenge as well as details of bacteria species isolated from the subjects 

  - Softwares: Javascript, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, VS Code
